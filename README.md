# Covid19-Stats
I have used a api called "Covid Monitor" form rapid API marketplace.
The api is given below :

https://coronavirus-monitor.p.rapidapi.com/coronavirus/latest_stat_by_country.php?country=country

From this api, you will get covid19 informantions such as,
Total Cases, New Cases, Active Cases, Recoverd Cases, Total deaths, New deaths and many more

[Note]: you will need a api key to use this api. Go to "https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/keys" to learn how to get your API application key.
